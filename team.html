     A3: Building Web Team Portfolio

        <p>We decided to utilize Wix as the primary tool for developing our Team Web Portfolio. The platform's simplicity attracted us. It is a straightforward and self-explanatory tool that most of our team members were familiar with. We considered WordPress and Squarespace, too, and we decided that we appreciate Wix's templates and overall structure more. 
          While we briefly contemplated the option of constructing a custom website using HTML, CSS, and JS for the team's portfolio, we had to consider the time we had to deliver the project. Time constraints associated with the course's duration made it apparent that delivering a high-quality website within the given timeframe would be challenging. This was especially true considering my personal decision to build a Personal Learning Portfolio website from scratch for the course, and attempting to create both team and personal portfolios would have been nearly impossible within the allocated time.
          
          Despite this, I committed to constructing a website for my personal portfolio independently. The motivation behind this decision was my eagerness to implement UX principles I learned from both the current and previous courses. Additionally, I saw it as an opportunity to challenge myself in creating a digital space that would reflect my individual style and skills. 
          The team we formed is great. My feelings towards my team buddies are the same after the first week of group work. All of us are pulling our weight and are genuinely invested In this project. It helps that we are all passionate about the subject. We were able to set up communication channels from the get-go and the communication has been smooth. In general, this teamwork has been smooth sailing and I believe it will stay that way. The determination that our team has to deliver an amazing project helps us to proceed efficiently.
