  <h2>W3 CSS Tutorial Reflections</h2>
  It was a very useful and informative video to me. Since I decided to actually code a website portfolio from scratch for this 
  course and not use any resources like Wix or Squarespace, this video was a lot of help in terms of styling my website. <br>
  <br>
   I aspire to be able to style websites in a beautiful and user friendly way and for that learning CSS is crucial. <br>
    My goal for this portfolio was to create and style a good looking website and the video helped me a lot of new concepts. <br>
    <br>
     A couple of years ago, before I even started university, I did an online Web Development course and there I learned a lot 
     of tools, tips and tricks, like Font Awesome for example, which was also mentioned in the video. Many things in the video
      were familiar to me, which was comfortable because sometimes it is nicer to brush up on something you already know. <br>
       It was a nostalgic moment when the author used Atom text editor to write code - I used to use Atom but it was unfortunately 
       discontinued a couple of years ago. I was terribly sad at the time because I genuinely loved that editor. <br>
       <br>
      
         I am glad that I have watched the video because it presented me with an oportunity to go down a memory lane. 
         I remember when I just started studying Web Development for the very first time, the concepts that nowadays seem basic
         and elementary to me, seemed extremely hard, almost unbearable.  <br>
         <br>
  The video brought a wave of very warm feelings to me and it was fun to re-live that beginner life that I had all over again."

  <h2>The Immutable Rules of UX by Jakob Nielsen</h2>
  The video taught me three key things: focus on users early, measure stuff for real information, and keep tweaking your design. <br>
  It's amazing how these principles, even with different names, have stuck around for so long.
  <br><br>
  I loved the part about the Swedish Vasa ship and the lesson that Jacob Nielsen pulled from the story which was test before 
  you launch. Sometimes, I am guilty of launching my projects without proper testing, and the reason for that is excitement and 
  impatience, but of course it is evident that testing, and testing many times in various ways is a very good practice when it comes to putting a digital product out in the public. Or any product, for that matter. 
  The quote, <q>You can never design the perfect interface the first time you try</q> hit home. It's true. It takes many tries to 
  get to the destination, and especially when it comes to UX design, or adjacent areas, like software development – you just need to 
  enjoy the process, because it will be a bumpy ride before you get the desired outcome. 
  <br><br>
  It was interesting to learn how the tiniest details, like a button having the wrong word, matter so much in terms of having a 
  successful product and retaining users. I also loved how he explained the difference between art and design. I would say I always 
  put those two in the same category but now that I think of it, it makes sense that they are different. Art is something you ponder 
  upon and think about whereas design needs to be functional and easy to use, it has to work. <br>
  I loved how he compared the two art pieces from ancient Greece. Primitive and simplistic vs deep and artistic. We can analyze both 
  images at different levels. It was eye opening to learn that what was true 2000 years ago is true today as well. <br>
  I agree with him how people come up with a new word for the same thing constantly. It affects communication and can lead to 
   misunderstanding which is bad for work processes and professional development in general. 
  What I learned most from the video is the importance of iteration. 
  <br><br>
  I enjoyed learning about the Microsoft study where they analyzed 2 billion pages and looked at how long people stayed on the page.<br>
   It showed that probability of leaving in the first couple of seconds is very high, but if you can capture their attention for 20 seconds, 
   the probability of leaving becomes lower. And following the UX principles is very important in this case as you need to manage to 
   get people attention in a very short time period with the right placement of features. Actually, after learning this, I had to make 
   changes to my personal portfolio design because I realized that the placement of certain text features wasn’t ideal and unless you
   as the teacher wouldn’t HAVE TO read it, it would be unlikely that you as a user would stay and read those texts for very long. 
   <br><br>
  I learnt that it’s crucial to focus on usefulness. The feature people can’t figure how to use might a well not exist. It is
   important to make sure feature is easily learnable as especially nowadays user is unlikely to spend a lot of time figuring out
    how to use a feature. <br><br>
  It was nice to be reminded at the end that UX is about people, not computers or programs, but really it is people at the core of
   it all. It’s crucial to put human experience at the heart of your design and everything will work out with that mindset.

<h2>Working as a Digital Designer</h2>
Learning from Felix's story was very incredibly helpful. <br>
Being an international student myself, I could relate to Felix a lot and understood 
perfectly where he was coming from. The beginning of the video where he talks about how he started off at McDonald’s speaks to me 
because I as well am working a customer service job along with my studies. I enjoyed how relatable the story was. 
His struggles with landing an internship hit close to home. <br>
I learnt that resilience and determination will pay off eventually. Sometimes, I myself felt lost in the beginning and was confused about all the different jobs and titles. It was a relief to hear that the confusion I felt in the beginning about job titles is pretty normal for new students.
His advice to pick a role and go for it was spot on. Getting a peek into his daily routine was fascinating – you think you know 
what a job involves, but there's always more behind the scenes.  <br>
Realizing that hard skills alone won't cut it in the job market was something I already knew. 
During my “Employment in Finland” course the teacher said that “All interns will have basically the same set of tech skills, 
but it is the soft skills that will set you apart”.  <br>
Nowadays the competition is way more fierce than ever before and polishing both those skills is crucial to advance in the job market. <br>
 Sales skills being crucial made sense, especially when he said, <q>If you can't explain why the product is great, no one cares.</q>
  I know I need to work on that, even though I've been leveling up my sales game since school started. Still, there's always room 
  to improve. <br>
The whole video was very enriching, I learned a lot but I was also happy to know that I knew quite a bit already.  <br>
<b>“Hard skills alone won’t be enough to get you thee job you want”</b> – was an awakening a lot of job seekers need to know.  <br>
It seems like a challenge to try to work on but it’s worth it.  <br>
<br>
I loved the video. It taught me new things but also it confirmed the things I already knew.

<h2>Living with Complexity</h2>
That was a brilliant video with a lot of profound points that Don Norman made.
<br>
<br>
Here are the <b>key findings</b> from me: <br>
<br>
1.	We are problem definers. I do not solve the problem I am asked to solve. It’s almost never the real problem. If you can get
 to the real problem the problem you’re asked to solve often may just go away. <br>
 <br>
2.	Great designers do great work because they don’t know anything. When you need to learn you ask questions, 
and you often ask stupid questions. But there is no such thing as a stupid question. When you ask stupid question 
and elaborate by asking why is that it becomes a profound question where you can work further and perhaps develop new bigger, 
better things. <br>
<br>
3.	If you look at engineering, there isn’t just a thing called engineering. In fact, there’s various types of engineering. 
There’s a room for any title as long there is a need. <br>
<br>
4.	What is the role of the designer and how can a designer make a difference? It’s a field of doing and making as opposed 
to for example engineers who think by mathematics. We think by trying and experimenting and we focus on people. A lot of sciences 
neglect people, they neglect the soft people skills that designers have. Tables, mathematics, computers is what a lot of scientific
 disciplines focus on and the person is hardly there. They want make sure everything Is as efficient as possible. <br>
 <br>
5.	I’m not interested in truth; I am interested in good enough. I am interested in the ability to take a complex medial system 
and make it better than it is today and keep making it better. But it doesn’t have to be a perfect system, not to say a “perfect
 system” doesn’t exist. What a designer has to do is put together. So, you can’t be narrow but you have to be broad. 
The university doesn’t teach you the word “together”. It makes you narrow instead of broad, and it makes you analyze instead of 
create and it teaches you to work all by yourself. 
I agree with that but also disagree. University might not teach togetherness, buy it does teach discipline and deadlines that are
 just as crucial as a sense of togetherness. <br>
 <br>
I absolutely loved, however, the example that if you don’t know an answer to a question you’re supposed to ask. In university were not allowed to do that otherwise it called cheating. In the workplace it is called collaboration. That was a very profound thought.

<h2>UI Design Principles</h2>

When evaluating the effectiveness of design work, it is crucial to consider a range of elements that contribute to a visually appealing and user-friendly product. <br>
<br>
This checklist that I made consists of key factors I will use to evaluate our project that should be examined when assessing the quality of design, drawing insights from principles such as symmetry, proximity, white space utilization, simplicity, visual weight, hierarchy, scale, unity, variety, and visual balance. 

<br>
<br>
<b>1.	Symmetry:</b><br>
<br>
Symmetry creates a sense of balance and order, contributing to a visually harmonious design. It ensures that elements are distributed evenly, enhancing overall aesthetics.<br>
<br>
<b>2.	Proximity:</b><br>
<br>
Grouping related elements together through proximity helps in establishing a clear visual hierarchy and improves the overall organization of content.<br>
<br>
<b>3.	White Space:</b><br>
<br>
Utilizing white space strategically allows users to focus on essential content without distraction. It enhances readability and attracts attention, creating a more engaging user experience.<br>
<br>
<b>4.	Simplicity:</b><br>
<br>
Keeping designs simple reduces cognitive load, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the interface. Simple designs are often more intuitive and user-friendly.<br>
<br>
<b>5.	Visual Weight:</b><br>
<br>
Assigning visual weight to elements helps emphasize their importance, guiding users' attention to key information and enhancing the overall impact of the design.<br>
<br>
<b>6.	Hierarchy:</b><br>
<br>
Establishing a clear hierarchy guides users through the content. Prioritizing information ensures that users can quickly identify and focus on the most important elements.<br>
<br>
<b>7.	Scale:</b><br>
<br>
Using scale effectively allows for controlled emphasis, ensuring that certain elements stand out. It contributes to a dynamic and visually engaging design.<br>
<br>
<b>8.	Unity and Variety:</b><br>
<br>
A designer can use both unity and variety strategically. Too much uniformity may lead to user confusion about what to pay attention to, while a balanced blend sparks visual interest and engagement.<br>
<br>
<b>9.	Visual Balance:</b><br>
<br>
Users perceive visually balanced designs as more aesthetically pleasing and, consequently, more usable. Achieving balance ensures that no single element dominates, providing a harmonious experience.<br>
<br>
<b>10.	Familiar Design Patterns:</b>
<br>
<br>
Providing design patterns familiar to users improves usability. Breaking down choices into smaller, simpler and promotes a smoother user experience.
By systematically considering elements such as symmetry, proximity, white space, simplicity, visual weight, hierarchy, scale, unity, variety, and visual balance, designers can ensure their work serves both aesthetic and functional goals.<br>
