    <p>The customer journey map is a unique tool that helps navigate through the world of user experiences. Through my experience with my UX journey (not only this course, but also the previous ones), I have come to appreciate the depth and insight this method provides. The journey map served as a visual story, and it allowed us as the team to identify key touchpoints, and pain points.
      It was especially helpful when we became deeply invested in our project and needed to understand the details of our potential user's engagement. It pushed us to approach our ideas with a sense of professionalism and a more profound understanding of the user's perspective.
      The process of creating a journey map was fun, as it made us step into the user's shoes, empathize with their journey, and anticipate their needs and challenges. One notable challenge of ours was the ability to accurately predict the user's path. Users, by nature, are unpredictable, and their interactions can fluctuate.
      Looking forward, I am excited about using the customer journey map tool in future projects as a part of the development process. It has become a must in my approach to user-centric design, and provided a structured way to make decisions and collaborate.

    <p>My Map, Sketch, and Decide journey brought both new and familiar things onto the surface.
      The interactivity that there was in these phases was interesting and exciting and added creativity to the process. There was a sense of urgency and pressure, which worked greatly for me since I perform best and generate better ideas under slight pressure. This style not only promoted creativity but also helped us think fast and produce ideas even faster. The collaboration enhanced the learning experience. Teamwork is so crucial in all parts of life so being exposed to teamwork, I believe, is beneficial for my development. Working together to build a storyboard was a powerful process of collective ideation. 
      Crazy 8s was familiar to me and I enjoyed it. The fast ideation was the main part of innovative thinking, making me veer away from conventional ideas and try to approach the problem with more creativity. 
      "Sticky decisions" method was new to me. It was interactive and vibrant. This method made decisions more approachable but also was fun and added joy into a process that at first might seem daunting. 
      Reflecting on these phases, the familiar aspects proved the importance of collaboration, ideation, and storyboarding in the design process. The new techniques, especially "Sticky decisions," expanded my tool-kit and taught me how to use interactive methodologies.
      This learning experience has been mix of new and familiar things. It provided me with a set of  new tools to professionally navigate the design process. The interactivity, pressure, collaboration, and introduction of new techniques made an impactful learning journey.

    <p>
      I'm really pleased with this UX course, just like I've been with the previous ones. The way you structure all your UX courses is exceptional—so organized and to the point. It's easy to follow the schedule, and honestly, it's interesting too. I must say say, the Moodle setup for all your courses is one of the best I've come across.
This course taught me a lot. Even though I did something similar before called "Digital Service Prototyping," with you previously, going through this course just boosted my skills and knowledge even more. Having a theme and clear objective every week, with a roadmap to follow, made the learning process very smooth. I loved how we did not jump straight into the deep end but ease into the work gradually—it really helped the learning process.

The videos for homework were a highlight for me. Extremely enlightening and engaging. I learned a lot, way more than I thought I would. I usually wouldn't go for those kinds of videos, but making them mandatory was a good call.
All the techniques in the course were practical and useful for my development—Lotus Blossom Lightning Demo, Map Sketch and Decide, Sticky Decision and Storyboard, Journey Mapping, Empathy Mapping. I’m grateful we needed to use all those techniques. 
We eventually moved to working on our prototype in Penpot. Since this time we all contributed to the prototype equally, I was happy to learn how to properly build one. Learning the tool was exciting and interesting, and I'm looking forward to using it more. I also spent some time on Figma too, and I'm thankful for that part of the course. Overall, it's been a great experience and I am looking forward to doing a Digital Service Project!
